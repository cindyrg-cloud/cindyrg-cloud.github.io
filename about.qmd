As a **Senior Business Analyst** I thrive at the intersection of **business strategy, data analytics, and technology**.

My journey from a **biochemistry background** to advanced analytics has given me a unique perspective on structured problem-solving — one that combines scientific precision with a business-first mindset.

As a **first-generation professional**, I’ve built my career around curiosity, perseverance, and a passion for uncovering stories hidden within data. Whether it’s building predictive models, optimizing reporting pipelines, or translating analytics into strategy, I take pride in bridging the technical and strategic sides of decision-making.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Professional Focus

In my current role, I design and implement **data-driven solutions** that enhance operational efficiency and drive measurable outcomes.\
My work spans **data modeling**, **automation**, and **reporting infrastructure**, always with a focus on aligning analytics to business impact.

I approach each project with a hybrid lens — thinking like a scientist, coding like an engineer, and communicating like a strategist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Technical Toolkit

**Languages & Tools:**\
Python • PySpark • SQL • Quarto • Git/GitHub • AWS EC2 • Power BI • Excel • URS • GPT • CoPilot

I’m deeply interested in the **full analytics lifecycle** — from wrangling raw data and developing predictive features to visualizing results through Quarto and publishing deliverables on GitHub Pages.

My recent project, the **Lightcast Salary Prediction Analysis**, involved training multiple regression models (GLR, Linear, Polynomial, and Random Forest), assessing performance metrics (RMSE, R², MAE), and visualizing patterns such as **salary vs. experience** and **feature importance** to uncover market insights.

##  Areas of Expertise

-   Predictive modeling and visualization\
-   Workforce analytics and job-market forecasting\
-   Process automation and reporting optimization\
-   Cloud-based analytics and scalable infrastructure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Career Vision

I aspire to evolve into an **Analytics or Machine Learning Product role**, where I can lead cross-functional teams to design data products that scale, automate, and innovate.

My long-term goal is to combine technical precision with strategic leadership — crafting data solutions that don’t just inform decisions but **shape the future direction of business**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Beyond the Data

Outside the world of analytics, I’m fueled by **Barre and Pilates**, **haunted attractions**, and **horror movie marathons** (preferably paired with pizza).

I share my home and creative energy with **Kylo**, my Bichon Frise and loyal co-pilot — the fluffy heart of *Kylo’s Corner*, my favorite part of this portfolio.
